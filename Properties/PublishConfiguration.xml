# ExtraHotkeys
A mod for Cities: Skylines 2 that adds extra hotkeys for opening the tool windows to the game.

## Changelog
- **v0.1.0** - Initial release.

## Features
- Adds extra hotkeys for opening the tool windows to the game that should have been there in the first place.
- Hotkeys can be customized in the game options menu.

## Instructions
- Install the mod from the Paradox Mods website, Skyve or the in-game mod browser.
- Go to the options menu in the game.
- Click on the "Extra Hotkeys" tab.
- Customize the hotkeys to your liking.

## Todo
- Add language support.
- Add mouse wheel support for quick selection of toolmodes (like in the discontinued mod "ExtendedHotkeys").
- Add more hotkeys (suggestions are welcome).

## Credits
- This mod is inspired by the discontinued mod "ExtendedHotkeys" by [89pleasure](https://github.com/89pleasure).
- Thanks to **rcav8tr** for the [CS2-Modding-Instructions](https://github.com/rcav8tr/CS2-Modding-Instructions) which helped me 
to kickstart my modding journey.

## Personal Note
I made this mod because I was tired of having to click on the toolbar to select the tools. Cities Skylines 1 had way more 
hotkeys than the sequel by default. And since I spend a few hundred hours in CS:1 , I got used to open the tools with hotkeys. 
So I decided to make this mod to add some of the hotkeys that I missed in CS:2. I hope you enjoy it!

I'm a long time web developer, but I just started to learn C# and Unity ECS a short time ago, so the code may not be the best 
or most efficient, but at least it works. This is my first mod for Cities Skylines 2, so I'm still learning. :-)
