## Personal Note
I made this mod because I was tired of having to click on the toolbar to select the tools. Cities Skylines 1 had way more 
hotkeys than the sequel by default. And since I spend a few hundred hours in CS:1 , I got used to open the tools with hotkeys. 
So I decided to make this mod to add some of the hotkeys that I missed in CS:2. I hope you enjoy it! Feel free to suggest
more hotkeys or features that you would like to see in this mod. 

I'm a long time web developer, but I just started to learn C# and Unity ECS a short time ago, so the code may not be the best 
or most efficient, but at least it works. This is my first mod for Cities Skylines 2, so I'm still learning. :-)
