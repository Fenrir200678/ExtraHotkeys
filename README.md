## Personal Note
I made this mod because I was tired of having to click on the toolbar to select the tools. Cities Skylines 1 had way more 
hotkeys than the sequel by default. And since I spend a few hundred hours in CS:1 , I got used to open the tools with hotkeys. 
So I decided to make this mod to add some of the hotkeys that I missed in CS:2. I hope you enjoy it!

I'm a long time web developer, but I just started to learn C# and Unity ECS a few month ago, so the code may not be the best 
or most efficient. This is my first mod for Cities Skylines 2, so I'm still learning. :-)
